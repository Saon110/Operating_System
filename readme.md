## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Linux/Unix environment
- GCC compiler
- Make utility
- QEMU (for xv6)
- Bash shell

### Running Shell Scripts (Offline 1)

```bash
cd Offline1/
chmod +x organize.sh task_a.sh task_b.sh task_c.sh

# Run the main organization script
./organize.sh <submission_path> <target_path> <test_path> <answer_path> [-v] [-noexecute]

# Run task A (file organization)
./task_a.sh
```

### Compiling and Running Pthread Programs (Offline 3)

```bash
cd offline3/pthread_materials/2105110/

# Compile the main program
g++ -pthread 2105110.cpp -o assignment

# Run with input file
./assignment < input.txt

# Or use the provided run script
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
```

### Building and Running xv6

```bash
cd xv6/xv6-riscv/

# Build the operating system
make

# Run in QEMU
make qemu

# Test custom system calls
history
dummyproc
testprocinfo
```

## üìã Assignment Details

### Shell Scripting Features

- **File Organization**: Automatically sorts student submissions by programming language

- **Error Handling**: Robust error checking and verbose output options
- **Testing Integration**: Supports automated testing frameworks

### Threading Assignment Features

- **Multi-station Simulation**: Simulates operatives working at different stations
- **Semaphore Management**: Uses semaphores for station access control
- **Reader-Writer Problem**: Implements reader-writer synchronization
- **Performance Metrics**: Tracks completion times and throughput

### xv6 System Call Features

- **History Command**: Tracks and displays command history
- **Process Information**: Custom system call for process statistics
- **Process Testing**: Utilities for testing process behavior

## üéØ Learning Objectives
